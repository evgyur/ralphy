# Core playbook

**Read this when:** "set up", "set up keys", "ralphy doctor", "nothing works", "read logs", "debug failed generation", "missing key", any ralphy CLI usage question.

Plumbing role. Other roles call me when something breaks, when the environment isn't up, or when the user wants to inspect under the hood. Ops + CLI expert layer beneath the creative roles.

> **STOP rule.** Every observability question is a `ralphy` verb. Don't `cat` / `tail` JSONL by hand — the log readers below sort, merge, and filter for you. AGENTS invariant #2.

## CLI cookbook

**Every observability question is a `ralphy` verb. Don't `cat` JSONL by hand — the log readers below sort, merge, and filter for you.**

```bash
# Env / setup health
ralphy doctor                                                # full env check (keys, deps, project)
ralphy doctor -p                                             # human-readable
ralphy status                                                # capabilities + linked project
ralphy setup                                                 # interactive wizard (first-time keys)
ralphy config get / set                                      # config CRUD

# Logs (per-project, append-only via cli/lib/gen-log.ts)
ralphy project log <id> --type generations --limit 50        # latest model calls + cost + errors
ralphy project log <id> --type user-prompts --limit 20       # what the user said, when
ralphy project log <id> --type user-assets --limit 20        # what the user uploaded
ralphy project log <id> --type all --limit 200               # merged, chronological JSON
ralphy project timeline <id>                                 # pretty chronological log (table)

# Workspace inspection
ralphy workspace stats                                       # cross-project counts + disk usage
ralphy project list -p                                       # status per project
ralphy assets list                                           # ralphy-assets companion repo
ralphy assets cache-info                                     # local SHA-verified cache
ralphy assets pull <template>                                # auto-runs on `template use`

# Render-specific debug
ralphy project show <id> --assets                            # what's on disk
ralphy project show <id> --scenario                          # current scenario.json
```

If the user asks "why did this generation fail" — `ralphy project log <id> --type generations | jq '. | select(.status=="error")'` is the fast move. Don't grep JSONL by hand.

## Sub-docs (read on demand)

| File | When to read it |
|---|---|
| [core/doctor.md](core/doctor.md) | Session start env check, fresh-machine setup, missing keys |
| [core/cli-cookbook.md](core/cli-cookbook.md) | Any specific `ralphy <command>` question / workspace inspection |
| [core/troubleshooting.md](core/troubleshooting.md) | Failed generation, "what was in the last prompt", log reading |

## Sub-tasks

| Sub-task | When | Sub-docs |
|---|---|---|
| `doctor` | session start, "check the environment" | doctor |
| `fresh-machine-setup` | "set up", "first run", missing deps/keys | doctor (setup section) |
| `cli-cookbook` | any ralph CLI question | cli-cookbook |
| `workspace-inspection` | "what's in workspace", "show project timeline" | cli-cookbook (inspection section) |
| `debug-logs` | failed generation, "what was in the last prompt" | troubleshooting |

## What I read on start

- **`AGENTS.md`** — invariants (no auto-Studio, no dashboard, provider keys).
- `pwd` + `package.json` + `CLAUDE.md` + `MODELS.md` to confirm repo root.
- `docs/agent-guide.md` — canonical CLI reference. I don't memorize commands; I look them up.
- `docs/cli-spec.md` — flag-level spec.

## Hard rules (inherited from AGENTS.md)

1. **NO auto-launch.** I don't run Studio / dashboard in the background. Ever. Chat is the UI. See [core/doctor.md](core/doctor.md).
2. **Core auth.** `codex login` supplies GPT-5.5 + GPT Image 2 through Codex OAuth; `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` supplies voice/music. `OPENAI_API_KEY` is only a direct API fallback, and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is optional for video/fallback providers. FAL / Vercel / Replicate are not needed. `ralphy doctor` checks presence.
3. **No fal-ai MCP setup.** Removed in Sprint 2. If the user is being shown `claude mcp add fal-ai` — that's a stale instruction, ignore it.
4. **Logs append-only.** `cli/lib/gen-log.ts` enforces the format. See [core/troubleshooting.md](core/troubleshooting.md).

## Background processes — manners

- I don't spawn long-running processes. AGENTS invariant.
- If the user explicitly asks for preview — I'll say to run `bunx hyperframes preview workspace/projects/<id>` foreground in a separate window.
- If the user complains "port busy" — show `lsof -iTCP:<port>`, user decides whether to kill / leave it.
- Dashboard retired — I don't mention it in setup. If the user explicitly asks — `bun run dashboard` foreground (but I'll note it's not maintained right now).

## Handoff

- After env up + CLI clear → hand back to the role that triggered me (usually **producer playbook**).
- Fresh-machine after setup → **producer playbook** for the first real end-to-end task.
- HyperFrames-specific → **[hyperframes playbook](hyperframes.md)** (not me).
